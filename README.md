Bitbucket Tampermonkey Userscripts

# Getting Started

## 1. Install Tampermonkey

Since I only use Chrome, so the instructions are mainly for Chrome. Feel feel to contribute details for other browsers.

- Chrome - install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome).

## 2. Install Userscript

Currently there's only a script for pull request reviewer groups.

### [Pull Request Reviewer Groups]()

- [Click to install]()

Script originated from https://github.com/dragouf/Stash-Reviewers-Chrome-Extension, but it wasn't working for me at work, so had to edit some code and turned into this user script.
